+++

Switzerland is one of the best countries if you love hiking. Its beautiful scenic mountains and landscapes are the ideal setting for the undoubtedly most beautiful hike of the three. Going on the longest of the hikes with us will pay off, as the Rhine Gorge is a truly fantastic sight in the region. Make sure to wear appropriate shoes and bring warm clothes, because it might be cold on that day.
